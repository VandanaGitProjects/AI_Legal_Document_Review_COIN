AI Legal Document Review – COIN Case Study
This repository presents a case study analysis of JP Morgan’s COIN (Contract Intelligence) system, an AI-driven solution designed to automate the review and classification of legal documents. The project demonstrates how machine learning and NLP can transform a traditionally manual, error-prone process into a scalable, efficient workflow.

🧠 Project Overview
Business Problem: Manual review of commercial loan agreements consumed over 360,000 hours annually, leading to high costs and potential errors.

Solution: Deploy an AI model to classify and interpret legal clauses using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Tool Used: JP Morgan’s proprietary AI system – COIN

Methodology: CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)
